 "Absolute risk": "This term refers to the **incidence of a disease in a population**. It indicates the **magnitude of risk** within a group exposed to a certain factor. However, absolute risk does not, by itself, show whether an exposure is associated with an increased risk of disease because it doesn't consider the risk in non-exposed individuals; **comparison is fundamental to epidemiology**. Despite this, absolute risk is still important for both clinical and public health implications. It is one of several measures of risk.",
  "Absolute risk reduction": "This term is **listed as a measure of occurrence** in epidemiology.",
  "Accuracy": "In the context of **screening tests**, accuracy is measured by examining the terms Reliability and Validity. It refers to the **ability of a diagnostic or screening test to correctly distinguish between individuals who have a disease and those who do not**. The two components of test accuracy, specifically validity, are **sensitivity and specificity**.",
  "Active immunity": " The sources do not provide a direct definition, but related concepts like *herd immunity* and *immunization* are discussed.",
  "Active surveillance": "This type of surveillance involves **project staff making active efforts to collect data**. It is generally **more accurate due to reduced under-reporting** compared to passive surveillance. An advantage is its enhanced completeness of reporting and accuracy because reporting is not dependent solely on passive mechanisms. However, it is generally **more expensive and requires more project staff**. It's used when an outbreak has occurred or a disease has been newly introduced, allowing for rapid detection of new cases.",
  "Adjusted odds ratio": "The Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome, controlling for the effect of one or more confounding variables. It estimates the odds of the outcome in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group, after statistically removing the influence of other factors that might also affect both the exposure and the outcome. This is typically achieved through multivariable regression techniques, most commonly logistic regression.",
  "Adjusted rate": "An Adjusted Rate (also known as a standardized rate) is a measure of disease frequency (e.g., incidence rate, mortality rate) that has been statistically modified to remove the effect of a confounding variable (most commonly age, but can be other factors like sex, race, socioeconomic status) when comparing populations. This allows for a fairer comparison between groups that may have different distributions of the confounding variable.",
  "Age distribution":"Age distribution refers to the proportionate numbers of people in different age categories in a given population. It describes how the population is divided among various age groups (e.g., 0-4 years, 5-14 years, 15-24 years, etc.). Age distribution is a fundamental demographic characteristic that significantly influences a population's health profile, social needs, and economic structure. It's often visualized using a population pyramid." ,
  "Age standardization":"Age standardization (or age adjustment) is a statistical technique used in epidemiology to remove the effect of differences in age composition when comparing health events (like disease rates or mortality rates) between two or more populations, or within the same population over time. This process allows for a more accurate comparison of disease risk or health outcomes, as it eliminates the confounding effect of age, which is a powerful determinant of many health outcomes. It can be performed using either the direct or indirect method." ,
  "Age-adjusted mortality rate": "This term refers to a **mortality rate that has been adjusted for age** [77, 79, 313–314, 314f]. It allows for comparisons of mortality between populations or over time, accounting for differences in age structures [184f].",
  "Age-specific mortality rate": "This term refers to a **mortality rate calculated for specific age groups**.",
  "Age-specific rate": "An Age-specific rate is a measure of disease frequency (e.g., incidence, prevalence, mortality) within a particular age group of a population. It's calculated by dividing the number of events (cases, deaths, etc.) occurring in that specific age group by the total number of person-time or individuals in that same age group, over a defined period. This allows for a more precise understanding of how rates vary by age,",
  "Agent": "In the **epidemiologic triad of disease**, the agent is one of three key components, alongside the host and the environment. It refers to the **infectious or other type of factor that causes human disease**, such as a bacterium. For malaria, the agent is *Plasmodium vivax*.",
  "Allocation concealment":"Allocation concealment is a methodological procedure in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that prevents foreknowledge of the treatment assignment (intervention or control) from anyone involved in the study – including participants, researchers, and healthcare providers – until the moment of randomization. The goal is to prevent selection bias by ensuring that the decision to admit a participant into the study is not influenced by the participant's prognosis or characteristics, which could inadvertently lead to an imbalance in baseline characteristics between the intervention and control groups." ,
  "Alpha error": "Also known as a **Type I error**, it is the **probability of concluding that treatments differ when, in reality, they do not differ**. This is the probability of a false positive conclusion.",
  "Analytic epidemiology": "This branch of epidemiology focuses on the **determinants of disease**. It seeks to **understand the how and why aspects of a health-related event**. Analytic studies are used to **test hypotheses** and look for and measure associations. They typically **require more resources and specialized knowledge** than descriptive studies. A key feature of analytic studies is the **use of comparison groups**. Examples include **case-control and cohort studies**, as well as randomized controlled trials and community interventions.",
  "Analytic study": "These studies are characterized by the **inclusion of a comparison group (control)** and emphasize identifying disease determinants. They are used to **test hypotheses** regarding risk factors and causes of disease, differing from descriptive studies which generate hypotheses. Types of analytic observational studies include **case-control and cohort studies**. Experimental studies, like randomized controlled trials, are also considered analytic.",
  "Applied epidemiology": "Applied epidemiology (also known as field epidemiology or public health epidemiology) is the practice of epidemiology to address and solve real-world public health problems. It involves the immediate application of epidemiological methods and principles to investigate, control, and prevent health events or problems in a population, often in real-time. This includes activities such as outbreak investigations, surveillance, program evaluation, and rapid assessment of public health issues." ,
  "Ascertainment bias":"Ascertainment bias (or detection bias) is a type of systematic error in epidemiological studies where the way information is collected or the way participants are identified differs between comparison groups. This differential ascertainment can lead to an over- or underestimation of the true association between an exposure and an outcome, because one group is more thoroughly investigated or more likely to have a particular outcome identified than another." ,
  "Association": "In epidemiology, an association refers to a **relationship or correlation between an exposure or characteristic and the risk of a disease** [179, 216–217, 243f, 271, 290, 291]. The goal of epidemiologic studies is to identify such associations. Associations can be **real or spurious (false)**. Guidelines are used to judge whether an observed association is causal. The **strength of association is measured by relative risk (or odds ratio)**; a stronger association is more likely to be causal.",
  "Asymptomatic infection": "In the context of the iceberg concept of disease, asymptomatic infections are those **without clinical illness** that are not visible clinically but are important in disease transmission. A related term, **subclinical disease**, is not clinically apparent and is not destined to become clinically apparent, often diagnosed by serologic response or culture.",
  "Attack rate": "The attack rate is defined as the **number of new cases of disease occurring during a specific period among exposed persons, divided by the total number of exposed persons during that same period**. It is **useful for comparing the risk of disease in groups with different exposures**. For example, in a foodborne outbreak, the attack rate for those who ate a certain food item can be calculated. It is a measure of morbidity.",
  "Attributable fraction": "This term is **listed as a measure of population impact**. It is equivalent to population attributable fraction or population attributable risk.",
  "Attributable fraction (exposed)": " It is similar to attributable risk for the exposed group.",
  "Attributable risk": "Attributable risk measures **how much of the disease incidence or risk can be attributed to a specific exposure**. It answers the question of **how much disease can be prevented if exposure to the causal agent is eliminated**. Unlike relative risk, which focuses on etiologic relationships, attributable risk has major applications in clinical practice and public health. It is one of several measures of risk.",
  "Bootstrapping": "This term is **listed as a statistical functional or method for resampling** in statistics and epidemiology. The sources do not provide a direct definition or detailed explanation.",
  "Bradford Hill criteria": "In 1965, Austin Bradford Hill proposed a series of considerations to **help assess evidence of causation**. These are sometimes taught as a checklist, but Hill himself stated **None of my nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause-and-effect hypothesis and none can be required *sine qua non*.**. The nine criteria are: **Temporal relationship, Strength of association, Dose-response relationship, Replication of the findings, Biologic plausibility, Coherence, Experiment, Analogy, and Specificity**.",
  "Burden of disease": "This term refers to the **extent of disease found in the community**. Understanding the burden of disease is critical for planning health services and facilities, and for training health care providers. It can be measured using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).",
  "Carrier": "A carrier is an individual who **harbors an infectious agent** and can transmit it to others, as seen in the cholera survey example.",
  "Case ascertainment": "This term refers to the process of **identifying all new cases of a disease in a population** during a specified time period.",
  "Case definition": "A case definition is a **standard set of criteria used to define and identify cases** in an outbreak investigation. It involves defining the numerator (the cases), including their clinical features, serologic/cultural aspects, and known causes. Molecular microbiology tools can be used to refine case definitions, leading to more targeted intervention strategies.",
  "Case report": "A case report is a **detailed description of the person, place, and time information of a specific case of disease or condition**. They usually involve **unexpected symptoms or events** and can alert epidemiologists to new problems, potentially leading to new hypotheses. They are purely descriptive and **cannot be used to make inferences about the general population**.",
  "Case series": "A case series describes the **person, place, and time information about a group of cases**. They can be **retrospective (backward looking) or prospective (forward looking)**. Case series can involve a small number of patients. They permit the **discovery of new diseases or unexpected effects** and provide data for generating hypotheses. Data from a case series may be used in analytic studies to investigate possible causal factors.",
  "Case": "A case refers to an **individual identified as having a disease or condition**. In a case-control study, subjects are selected based on their disease status, forming a case group.",
  "Case-fatality rate": "Case-fatality is defined as the **number of people who die from a specific disease divided by the total number of people who have that disease**. It represents the **likelihood that a person with a given disease will die from it**. This differs from a mortality rate, where the denominator includes anyone at risk of dying from the disease, whether they have it or not. It is a measure of prognosis.",
  "Case-control study": "A type of **observational, analytic study design** where subjects are selected based on their disease status. It is a **retrospective study**, looking back in time at potential exposures. A group of **individuals with the disease (cases) is compared to a group of individuals without the disease (controls)**. The **odds ratio (OR)** is the statistic generated to measure association in case-control studies. They are more useful when the disease is relatively rare and there are many possible exposures. Selection bias and recall bias are potential problems in these studies.",
  "Case-crossover study": "A study design used to investigate the **short-term effects of transient exposures** on the risk of an event. In this design, for each subject, the level of exposure during an at-risk period (immediately prior to the event) is **compared to a control period** (a time unlikely to be relevant to the event's occurrence).",
  "Causal diagram":"A Causal Diagram (often a Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG) is a visual representation of the assumed causal relationships between variables in a study. It uses nodes (representing variables like exposures, outcomes, and confounders) and arrows (representing direct causal effects) to depict the hypothesized flow of causality. These diagrams are used to clarify assumptions about causal pathways, identify potential confounding variables, and guide the selection of appropriate statistical adjustment strategies to avoid bias (e.g., collider bias, confounding)." ,
  "Causal inference": "The process of **determining whether an observed association between an exposure and a disease reflects a true causal relationship** [48, 120, 137, 243f, 291, 317]. It involves evaluating evidence based on guidelines such as the Bradford Hill criteria. Bias, confounding, and interaction are critical issues to consider when deriving causal inferences.",
  "Causal pathway": "A causal pathway can be **direct, where a factor directly causes a disease without intermediate steps, or indirect, where a factor causes a disease through intermediate steps** [248, 248f, 296]. In human biology, intermediate steps are almost always present in any causal process.",
  "Causality": "This refers to the **relationship between a cause and its effect**, particularly in epidemiology, the identification of causal relationships between exposures and outcomes is an important aspect. Criteria for evaluating cause-effect relationships include the Bradford Hill criteria. Disease does not occur randomly but in patterns reflecting underlying causal factors.",
  "Censoring": " It is relevant in survival analysis where subjects may not be observed for the entire study period.",
  "Chain of infection": " It describes the sequence of conditions that allows an infectious agent to move from a source to a susceptible host.",
  "Chi-square test": "This term is **listed as a statistical test** used in epidemiology. The sources do not provide a direct definition or detailed explanation.",
  "Chronic disease": "Refers to diseases of **long duration and generally slow progression**, such as heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and stroke. There has been a dramatic shift in leading causes of death from infectious to chronic diseases in the 20th century. In many chronic diseases, causal relationships are complex, with factors that are neither sufficient nor necessary.",
  "Clinical disease": "Clinical disease is characterized by **signs and symptoms**. In the iceberg concept of disease, clinical illness is the **only readily apparent part of disease**, with much of the disease being subclinical.",
  "Clinical significance":"Clinical significance refers to the practical importance or meaningfulness of a treatment effect or research finding, especially in terms of its impact on a patient's health, quality of life, or clinical management. Unlike statistical significance, which indicates whether a result is likely due to chance, clinical significance addresses whether the magnitude of the observed effect is large enough to be considered useful, relevant, or beneficial in a real-world clinical setting. A statistically significant finding may not always be clinically significant, and vice-versa." ,
  "Clinical trial": "A type of **experimental study** typically used for evaluating new medicines or drugs. Subjects are assigned to exposures **randomly** and followed over time to determine disease development or recovery. They are considered the **gold standard for evaluating the efficacy and side effects of new forms of intervention**. Clinical trials are typically Phase I, II, III, or IV trials.",
  "Cluster": "A cluster is defined as a **group of cases in a specific time and place that might be more than expected**. For example, an outbreak of measles among employees at a factory could be described as a cluster. It is distinct from an epidemic, which is defined as an occurrence of disease in excess of what is expected.",
  "Clustering":"Clustering in epidemiology refers to an unusually high incidence of a particular disease, health event, or other phenomenon that is grouped in terms of place (spatial clustering), time (temporal clustering), or both place and time (spatio-temporal clustering). Identifying clusters can sometimes point to environmental hazards, infectious disease outbreaks, or specific risk factors that are localized. However, apparent clusters can also occur by chance, so careful investigation is required to determine if a true underlying cause exists." ,
  "Coherence": "One of the **Bradford Hill criteria for causation**. It suggests that **consistency between epidemiological and laboratory findings increases the likelihood of an effect**. However, lack of laboratory evidence does not nullify epidemiological associations.",
  "Cohort effect": "This term refers to the **impact of being part of a specific group that shares a common experience or characteristic** (e.g., birth year) on health outcomes [81, 82t–83t].",
  "Cohort study": "A type of **observational, analytic study design** where subjects are categorized based on their **exposure to one or more risk factors** and then observed over time to see who develops the disease. In contrast to randomized trials, subjects are **not randomly assigned to exposure**. Cohort studies can be **prospective (concurrent) or retrospective (historical)**. They allow for the **direct calculation of incidence rates and relative risk**. The **Framingham Heart Study** is a classic example. They are useful when exposure is rare.",
  "Cohort": "A cohort is a **group of people who share similar characteristics**. Examples include people in the same school, church congregation, town, city, or occupation.",
  "Common source outbreak": "An epidemic where cases are derived from a **common source**.",
  "Community trial": "A type of **experimental study** focusing on **interventions or research on social originating diseases at the group level**.",
  "Comorbidity adjustment":"Comorbidity adjustment is a statistical technique used in epidemiological research and healthcare outcomes studies to account for the presence of co-existing medical conditions (comorbidities) in individuals when analyzing the relationship between a primary exposure or intervention and an outcome. Since comorbidities can independently influence the outcome or modify the effect of the primary exposure, failing to adjust for them can lead to confounding or biased estimates of effect. Adjustment methods often involve including comorbidity measures as covariates in regression models or using risk-stratification techniques." ,
  "Co-morbidity": "This term refers to **preexisting diseases or conditions** that may or may not be specifically related to the disease being studied but can influence the prognosis or outcome.",
  "Competing risk":"A competing risk is an event whose occurrence prevents the occurrence of the primary event of interest, or fundamentally changes the probability of that primary event. In survival analysis, it refers to a situation where individuals can experience one of several different events, and the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others (or at least the primary one). Ignoring competing risks can lead to an overestimation of the cumulative incidence of the event of interest, especially if the competing event is common." ,
  "Concordance": "In the context of twin studies, **concordance refers to the presence of a trait or disease in both twins**. Concordance rates are used to explore the etiologic role of genetic factors, especially for continuous variables like blood pressure.",
  "Conditional probability":"Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It expresses how the probability of an event changes (or is conditioned upon) the knowledge that some other related event has happened." ,
  "Confidence interval": " The sources mention it implicitly in discussions of precision of estimates.",
  "Confidence level":"The Confidence Level is the probability that a randomly selected confidence interval (e.g., for a mean, proportion, or odds ratio) will contain the true (unknown) population parameter. It expresses the reliability of the estimation process. Common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%. A 95% confidence level means that if the study were repeated many times, 95% of the calculated confidence intervals would contain the true population parameter." ,
  "Confounding by indication":"Confounding by indication (also known as confounding by contraindication or channel bias) is a specific and common type of confounding that occurs in observational studies when the reason a patient receives (or does not receive) a particular treatment or exposure is itself a prognostic factor for the outcome. In other words, the indication (the severity of disease, presence of symptoms, or underlying risk factors) for which a treatment is prescribed is also a risk factor for the outcome of interest, independent of the treatment's effect. This can make it appear as though the treatment is either beneficial or harmful when, in fact, the observed association is due to the underlying reason for prescribing the treatment." ,
  "Confounding": "Confounding is a type of **systematic error (bias)** in a study that leads to a mistaken estimate of an exposure's effect. It occurs when a third factor is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, distorting the observed relationship between them. Methods to deal with confounding in observational studies include **individual matching, stratification, and group matching, or adjustment**. Properly conducted randomized studies aim to minimize confounding.",
  "Consistency": "One of the **Bradford Hill criteria for causation**, also called **Consistency of Data**. It states that **consistent findings observed by different persons in different places with different samples strengthen the likelihood of an effect**.

  "Cross-over design": "A study design where **participants receive a sequence of different treatments**. Also referred to as a crossover trial.",
  "Crossover trial": "A type of randomized trial where **subjects are switched between treatment groups** during the study [148-151, 149f–150f]. It can be **planned or unplanned**.",
  "Cross-sectional study": "A type of **observational, descriptive study design** where **exposure and disease outcome are determined simultaneously for each subject at a single point in time**. It's like a **snapshot of the population**. Also known as a **prevalence study** because it identifies prevalent cases of disease. While suggestive of possible risk factors, its **limitations in establishing a temporal relationship** mean cohort and case-control studies are relied upon for etiologic relationships.",
  "Crude mortality rate": "The **total number of deaths in a given population over a specified period, divided by the total population at mid-year**, often expressed per 1,000 persons. Also known as **annual mortality rate (all causes)**. It provides a general overview but does not account for differences in population characteristics (e.g., age structure) that might influence mortality.",
  "Crude rate": " It refers to a rate that has not been adjusted for any population characteristics.",
  "Cumulative incidence": "This measures the **proportion of a population that develops the disease over a specified period**. It describes the **number of new cases of a disease during a specific time in a specific population**. It allows for the calculation of true rates of disease occurrence for better risk estimation. For example, an interview question like Have you ever had asthma? could be used to measure cumulative incidence.",
  "Cumulative incidence rate": " It is synonymous with cumulative incidence.",
  "Cumulative incidence ratio":"The Cumulative Incidence Ratio (CIR), also known as the Risk Ratio (RR), is a measure of association used in cohort studies. It compares the cumulative incidence (risk) of an outcome in an exposed group to the cumulative incidence (risk) of the same outcome in an unexposed group over a specified period. It indicates how many times more (or less) likely the exposed group is to develop the outcome compared to the unexposed group." ,
  "Cumulative risk":"Cumulative Risk (or Cumulative Incidence) is a measure of the proportion of a population that develops a particular outcome (e.g., disease, death) over a specified period. It is often referred to as the risk or absolute risk. It assumes that the entire population at risk is followed for the entire period and that no one is lost to follow-up or dies from another cause related to the outcome." ,

Sources can include individual persons (via questionnaires), medical records (electronic health records), sales records (e.g., cigarette sales), or court records (e.g., intoxicated driver arrests). The quality and completeness of collected data are crucial for study validity.",
  "Data dredging":"Data dredging also known as p-hacking, data snooping, data fishing, or fishing expedition is the practice of repeatedly analyzing data or searching for statistically significant relationships between variables without a pre-specified hypothesis. This involves trying out many different statistical tests, variables, or subgroups until a statistically significant result is found. While exploratory data analysis is valuable, data dredging can lead to spurious findings, as random chance alone guarantees that some "significant" results will appear when enough comparisons are made, even if no true underlying relationship exists." ,
  "Data quality": "Refers to the **reliability, completeness, and accuracy of data fields** in reports received by a surveillance system. Ensuring data quality is essential before interpreting epidemiologic data or drawing conclusions.",

Types include passive and active surveillance.",
  "Disease transmission dynamics": " It refers to the study of how diseases spread within and between populations.",
  "Dose-response relationship": "A criterion for causation, indicating that **as the dose of exposure increases, the risk or incidence of the effect (disease) also increases**. Its presence is strong evidence for a causal relationship, but its absence does not necessarily rule out causation, especially if a threshold exists.",

  "Effect size": " It quantifies the magnitude of an effect.",
  "Effectiveness": "Refers to **whether an agent or intervention works under ordinary, real-world conditions**. It is a measure used in evaluating health services. Unlike efficacy (ideal conditions), effectiveness considers typical adherence, patient populations, and health care systems.

  "Epidemic": "Defined as the **occurrence of a disease among a population that is in excess of what is expected in a given time and place**. It implies a deviation from the usual occurrence of disease. For example, a single case of cholera in an area where it hasn't been reported for a long time can be considered an outbreak/epidemic. The Ebola virus outbreak in parts of Africa is described as an epidemic. The term epidemiology itself is derived from Greek meaning the study of what is upon the people and was first used to describe the study of epidemics.",
